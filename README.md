# Data warehouse and HR Employee Distribution Report Project
The HR Employee Distribution Report project showcases a full data warehousing pipelineâ€”from sourcing and transforming HR data into a star schema, to running analytics with SQL and visualizing insights in Power BI. It emphasizes best practices like dimensional modeling, ETL workflows, and KPI reporting to deliver actionable business intelligence on employee demographics and department structures.

# Data Artchitecture
* Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
* Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
* Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
